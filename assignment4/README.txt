The assignment code consists of 9 python files

Main.py - triggers the code for problems
Perceptron.py - perceptron and dual perceptron algorithm
PerceptronKernel.py - perceptron algorithm with rbf and linear kernel
RegularizedLogisticRegression.py - logistic regression and regularized logistic regression algorithm
SVM.py - SVM algorithm 
ModifiedSVM.py - Modified SVM with chunking
SVMAUC.py - SVM algorithm with AUC
ModifiedSVMAUC.py - Modified SVM algorithm with AUC chunking
SVMMulticlass.py - Multiclass SVM algorithm
SVMMulticlassAUC.py - Multiclass SVM algorithm with AUC chunking

The code requires pandas, numpy, matplotlib and sklearn libraries to compile and run successfully

run Main.py to triggere script run for all questions. The data files have to reside in the same directory. The plots will be saved to the same directory on successfull completion
